# VRChat Pog Champ Game
PogChamp is a digital version of the classic game Pogs for VRChat, where you can compete against others in a virtual environment, flipping pogs in a fun and interactive way!
Play it on desktop or immerse yourself in VR for an extra layer of excitement!
It is suitable for social worlds, game areas, or any environment where you want to include a simple interactive activity.

# Game Modes
The Pog Champ Game includes three modes:

- **Survival:** Each player starts with 100 pogs. Players take turns slamming their stack. Any pogs that are flipped are removed from their stack. The last player with pogs remaining wins.

- **Race:** Each player starts with 100 pogs. Players take turns slamming their stack. The first player to flip all of their pogs wins.

- **Classic:** Each player contributes 25 pogs to a shared pool. Players take turns slamming the stack. Any pogs a player flips are added to their collection. When all pogs have been flipped, the player with the most pogs wins.

# Installing

Project Requirements:
- The latest VRChat Worlds SDK installed
- The latest UdonSharp package installed
- TextMeshPro

Installation Steps:
- [Download the latest release unity package](https://github.com/chibiskuld/pogchamp/releases/latest)
- Import Unity Package to your project
- From the "Pog Champ/World" folder, drag and drop the prefab "PogChampStation" into your world scene.
- Place it where you want! Scale it, play with it, adjust it, whatever, and if you break it, just re-import and try again.

Other Stuff:
In the "Pog Champ/Avatar" folder there are some extras for putting a mini pog champ game onto your avatar as well! Currently there is no guaranteed support for it, but feel free to have fun with it!

# Custom Slammers
You can also add custom slammers to your avatar! You can do this by animating a projectile or "weapon" with a contact sender.
Just add a contact sender to your avatar with the collision tag, "PCSLAMMER". Pog Champ has been designed to allow interaction from the current player and this tag.
